**Perspective Bot** is a Chrome Extension where we can input the news we hear about to get more context about it. Using Machine Learning algorithms like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and clustering, the bot can show different perspectives about the news grouped by countries with the most hits about the news.
